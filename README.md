# taskmodoro

taskmodoro is a fork of [tgrosinger/tq-obsidian)](https://github.com/tgrosinger/tq-obsidian). It’s an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) file-based task manager with integrated pomodoro timer. Each task is represented as a Markdown note with a single task line and some metadata in the frontmatter. Tasks are viewed by embedding queries in other notes, such as your Daily Note.

**More functionality will be added to this plugin when needed by my tasks workflow**.

Contributions are very welcome.

## Query blocks

Tasks query synax with few differences is very similar to [obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin although supported feature set is more limited.

Tasks can be queried by using custom code blocks in notes. Here's an example:

Include all tasks with `#inbox` tag grouped by completion status.

  

	```tq
	tags include #inbox
	group by completed
	```


  

Or for a more complicated example:

  

	```taskmodoro
	scheduled after 2022-07-28
	due before 2022-08-05
	not completed
	group by tags
	exclude subtasks
	```

### Limitations

### Acknowledgments
Current feature set wouldn’t be possible without the initial functionality provided by the creator of [tgrosinger/tq-obsidian](https://github.com/tgrosinger/tq-obsidian) . 

And some features reproduced from  [obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) , [mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugins.
