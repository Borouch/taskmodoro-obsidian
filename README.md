# tq

tq is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for managing tasks using a file-based workflow. Each task is represented as a Markdown note with a single task line and some metadata in the frontmatter. For example:

```
---
due: '2021-06-30'
tags: 'work'
repeat: every Friday
completed:
  - '2021-06-18'
  - '2021-06-11'
---

- [ ] File TPS reports

```

Tasks can be viewed and edited from the tq view. In the future it will be possible to embed task views in other notes.

This plugin is still under active development and is not yet feature complete. It does however have the basic functionality, and I'll be adding more as needed by my tasks workflow.
